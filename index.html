            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p id="Introduction">
                Bluntly put: My folders in firefox are overcrowded with dozens of links that are either <b>important for my thesis</b> or <b>important for my studies</b>. 
                I could theoretically keep everything just in firefox and organize my folders in there, but what if i want to keep more than just some floating links, 
                like the actual PDF for scientific papers or exported Images of Webpages (results in a PDF in my case). Therefore i need a structured, yet efficient way to 
                store and sort my current data, but also a way of dealing with any data, that might arrive in the future (presume: i live another day. This will be updated as soon as i won't).

            <h2>Theoretical Approach</h2>
            <p id="Theoretical Approach">
                Let's visually imagine ('visualize' implies too much) a gigantic, ideally infinitely large library. Such a massive structure needs to be well... organized! <br>
                In order to find anything, you'd already need an structured approach to finding anything in this library. Gladly there exists a very simple 'system', which we use everyday 
                (and have sometimes done in our childhood) <b>tagging</b>! Now there exist many ways to prevent an infinite amount of tags comming in, commonly a stemming-algorithm 
                (which we already know how it works, since this is applied in the english language, when trying to find the 'original', i.e. stem, of any given word).
